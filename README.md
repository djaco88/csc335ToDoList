Learning Experience: 

Working with a larger group on this project was in many ways easier than the previous two-person projects. Many of the problems from previous projects weren't an issue for us. We were able to all contribute code with various IDEs and from computers using different OS. It definitely felt like we learned a lot about coding with others in the projects leading to this one. We did still encounter some git merging errors in the begining since everyone had their own branch that they were working on. The main branch was sometimes days behind the rest, but we got that sorted in the first week or so. The project coordination was made easier with Trello, but really constant communication via discord was key to our success. The project itself was a bit simpler than some of the previous ones, so we were able to focus on a lot of the details that make our project look and feel finished. Our project runs smoothly and we were able to fix all of the bugs we could find that might affect the user experience. Using JavaFX we were able to create CSS files to add color and depth to our display. We feel confident with our final result and hope you enjoy it!
